Hi.
Even though i made it in classic way it smells to me like it's something that should be solved with Data Oriented Design 
(entity component system). Which is i need to do more research in. Btw.. here we also have a candidate for work on another thread. That 
enemy choosing could be a background task of course with some modifications, cuz we can't use Unity's API there.

And i don't quite understood a request of making targeting area no larger that 1/20th of game play area.. My turret about 1/20th part itself :) So there is some other adjustable values.
